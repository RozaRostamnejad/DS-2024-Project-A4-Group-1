# Project Description

This project is focused on classifying variants from the ClinVar dataset using machine learning models. The dataset contains information on gene variants, and our objective is to predict if a given variant will be classified as "conflicting" or "non-conflicting". We utilize various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, SVC, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to achieve this goal.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing class distribution using SMOTE.
EDA: Summary statistics, visualization of null values, and exploration of gene-symbol relationships.
Feature Engineering: Encoding gene symbols and filtering genes by their frequency.
Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, SVC, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
